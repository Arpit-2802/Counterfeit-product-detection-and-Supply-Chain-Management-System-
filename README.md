  This system allows manufacturers to store the details of the product in the blockchain and manufacturers can create the QR code of the product batch. They can distribute the products to different Retailers and Retailers can further Sell the product. The customer can scan the QR code and verify the product's supply chain history. Merely based on the fact that the last location of a product differs from the customer's point of purchase, it cannot be concluded that the customer is buying counterfeit goods.
</p>
<p>The Dapp includes abilities and  functionalities that allow manufacturers to monitor retailers and track the number of products sent to each retailer. All of this information is securely stored in a blockchain system based on smart contracts, which enhances trust among the users. By leveraging this technology, the Dapp ensures transparency and immutability, offering users a reliable and trustworthy platform for managing and verifying retailer and product distribution data.</p>
